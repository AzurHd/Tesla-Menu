# Tesla-Menu

The initial overlay menu to be loaded by nx-ovlloader. It's main purpose is to let the user select other overlays to be loaded.
The default directory for overlays is `/switch/.overlays` where only .ovl files (Plain old .nro files renamed to .ovl to differentiate them from normal homebrew) get loaded.
